# Mine vs Rock Prediction

This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as either mines or rocks based on the Sonar dataset.

## Files

- `Mine_vs_Rock_Pred.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning analysis and prediction model
- `Copy of sonar data.csv`: Dataset containing sonar signals for classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a classification model to distinguish between sonar signals reflected from mines and rocks. The analysis includes:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning libraries (likely pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Mine_vs_Rock_Pred.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis

## Dataset

The dataset contains sonar signals with features representing different frequency bands, used to classify whether the signal was reflected from a mine or a rock.
